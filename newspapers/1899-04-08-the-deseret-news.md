#REUNION OF ARTILLERYMEN

*Veterans of the Nauvoo Legion Indulge in the Merry Dance.*

*A MOST PLEASING AFFAIR*

*The Finger of Time Seemed to Turn Backward, and Old Again Became Young.*

Nearly one hundred members of the old Nauvoo Legion gathered in the Thirteenth ward assembly hall last night on the occasion of the reunion of the majority of the surviving members of that brigade.

The gathering was the first of a series of similar concourses of the association of Veteran Artillerymen of the Nauvoo Legion held since 1870, when the Legion was practically dissolved by Governor Shaffer.

The artillerymen organized organized their association Sept. 14, 1897, and meet on the first Wednesday in each month in the Templeton building. Members of any branch of the Legion may become members and their male descendants. The board of directors and officers are:

R. W. McAllister, president; A. J. Taysum, vice president; William H. Perkes, secretary; D. M. McAllister, assistant secretary; William Asper, treasurer; John D. Airmet, director; Dan Weggeland, director.

The gathering, as before announced, was to have been held by "early candle light," but it was nearly 8 o'clock when Brigadier General J. D. T. McAllister called the assembled veterans to order. Among those who were observed to be present were Brigadier General Franklin D. Richards, Captain Lorenzo Snow, General R. T. Burton, Adjutant General H. B. Clawson, Brigadier General Brigham Young, Colonel G. M. Ottinger, Dr. Seymour B. Young, Colonel J. R. Winder, Colonel T. G. Webber, Major John Clark, George Q. Cannon, Joseph F. Smith, William Calder, Samuel Bateman, William Sadler and David Anderson.

Colonel and Bishop J. R. Winder, who offered prayer, asked a special blessing on "those veterans who had seen service in the defense of Israel."

President Joseph F. Smith then arose and after welcoming the veterans to the hall in a brief speech proceeded to introduce "Captain" Lorenzo Snow.

Present Snow responded in a few well chosen words, and stated that he was glad to be called captain on such an occasion; he went on to relate the circumstances surrounding his promotion from ensign to captain of the Legion and concluded his remarks with good wishes for the assembled silver haired artillerymen.

Dr. Seymour B. Young followed the President with a few brief remarks, then the company formed for a quadrille and proceeded to tread the mazey measure to the strains of music. How those veterans did dance! The strains of music seemed to put Old Time's clock back half a century, backs straightened up and eyes brightened as the prompter called off: "Salute your partner. All join hands, forward and back, and do-se-do," and away they went chassaying and tripping the light fantastic with the ease and grace of youth.

After the first dance all present indulged in a breathing spell while Gen. Robert T. Burton told a few anecdotes regarding the "minute-men" of 1849. He was followed by Bishop John R. Winder who related some incidents connected with a three days' compulsory fast that finally led up to the stern resolve to sacrifice the life of a mule that was along with the company.

"He was the most resigned-looking mule I ever saw," said the old soldier. "He was really a beautiful sight, but his innocent life was saved by the opportune arrival of food."

General H. B. Clawson then related the incidents surrounding the Indian scares down in the vicinity of Utah Lake and concluded his brief address with a glowing tribute to the Utah volunteers in far off Manila that was received with much enthusiasm by the patriotic veterans assembled.

The evening's entertainment consisted in fact of alternate dances and speech-making with here and there a song interspersed. General McAllister was the first singer and surprised those present by his excellent rendition of the old favorite "Hearts and Homes," the entire company joining in the chorus with a resonant swing.

Refreshments were then in order, served and handed round by the young, beautiful and buxom daughters of some of the veterans who were present.

William Colton then sang pleasingly, "One False Step Will Ever Lead to More," and with an old time waltz the proceedings were brought to a close and the veterans escorted their silver-haired "best girls" to their respective homes.

##HISTORY OF THE LEGION.

The people of Utah, in early days, were sometimes sorely harassed by Indian depredations, and they found it necessary to inaugurate military proceedings for the protection of their lives and property. As many of the Pioneers had been enrolled in the Nauvoo Legion of Illinois, and therein acquired experience in military tactics, it was considered advisable to use them in the emergencies associated with the early settlement of Utah. Accordingly by statute of the Territorial Legislature, passed in March, 1852, the officers and men of the Nauvoo Legion were reorganized for active service.

The Legion, thus re-established, and subsequently augmented in numbers, proved effective in subduing the Indians, and it naturally developed into the militia of the Territory. It was maintained in good working order, by frequent drilling and yearly reviews, until 1879, when Governor Shaffer issued his edict forbidding further gatherings of that character. This action virtually disbanded the Legion, although it was not officially dissolved until March 1887.

The men who enlisted in the Legion, and were comrades in-arms during the trying scenes of Navuoo, and afterwards in this region, naturally became affectionately attached. The surviving artillerymen of the Legion having been invited to take part in the Jubilee exercises of 1897, were so pleased to meet again that they decided to organize a society to perpetuate the history of their battalion, encourage social relations among the members, and render aid to each other and their families, in cases of sickness of death. A organization of that character was accordingly effected, and adopted the name which appears at the beginning of this article.

The plan of the association is similar to that of other friendly societies, and it is not a secret order. The members hold social and business meeting on the first Wednesday of each month, in the College Lecture Hall, Templeton building, commencing at 7:30 p. m. A committee is appointed to visit those who are reported to be sick or destitute. A [leading feature] is the establishment of a mortuary fund, each member being [?] one dollar on the death of any one of their members; the amount then collected is paid to the family of the deceased.

Several historic cannon have been placed in care of the association, and an armory has been established in the basement of the Presiding Bishop's office, Salt Lake City, where the guns alluded to and numerous other relics of the Nauvoo Legion have been deposited, and can be seen by visitors. Persons who have in their possession arms, accoutrements, flags or other mementoes of the Legion are invited to deposit them also in the armory.

Although the association has been organized by the Veteran Artillerymen, it is provided that any others who were enrolled in the Nauvoo Legion, before 1871, may become members on the same conditions as the artillerymen. Male descendants--over eighteen years of age--of any of them are also eligible to membership. In all cases good moral character is a pre-requisite. Female relatives are regarded as honorary members, an can attend the social gatherings.
